## ABOUT PAGE CONTENT

### Hero Section

**Headline:**
```
Engineering AI That Actually Works
```

**Subheading:**
```
We're not another AI consultancy. We're engineers who build
production-ready systems for enterprises that care about privacy,
reliability, and results.
```

### Our Story

```
Genrec AI started with a simple observation: most AI solutions
are built for Silicon Valley, not for construction sites,
hotel dining rooms, or classrooms.

We saw enterprises struggling with generic AI tools that didn't
understand their workflows, didn't protect their data, and
didn't deliver measurable ROI. So we decided to build something
different.

Today, we're an engineering studio focused on three industries
where we can make the biggest impact: construction, hospitality,
and education. We build privacy-first, domain-specific AI systems
that solve real problems for real businesses.

We're not trying to be everything to everyone. We're focused
on being the best engineering partner for enterprises that need
AI that actually works in production.
```

### Our Values

**1. Mission-Driven**
```
We're here to make AI work for real businesses, not to chase hype. 
Every line of code serves a purpose.
```

**2. Client-First**
```
Your success is our success. We don't build what we think you need — 
we build what actually solves your problems.
```

**3. Innovation with Restraint**
```
We use cutting-edge tech when it makes sense, proven solutions when 
it doesn't. Pragmatism beats novelty.
```

**4. Engineering Excellence**
```
Clean code, proper documentation, and systems that scale. We build 
like we'll maintain it forever — because we might.
```

### Our Approach

**Step 1: Listen First**
```
We start by understanding your actual problems, not selling you
solutions. Every engagement begins with deep discovery.
```

**Step 2: Build Small, Prove Value**
```
We run 4-6 week pilots with real data and real users.
No PowerPoints — just working software you can test.
```

**Step 3: Scale Thoughtfully**
```
Once we've proven value, we help you deploy across your
organization with proper training, support, and documentation.
```
